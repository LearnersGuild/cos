# Growth Tension

## Challenge &lt;--&gt; Support

The Growth Tension optimizes the energies between challenge and support. We hold the fundamental belief that all people can learn and grow, and are driven by a deep desire to do so. When encountering novel situations that challenge our limits, we need an appropriate amount of support to meet those challenges.

Support without challenge keeps us complacent and stagnant, while challenge without support can lead to anxiety and low morale. We seek to create a high challenge, high support environment that, when achieved, keeps us in our "stretch" zone, or [Zone of Proximal Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development), where we can accomplish things with support that we can't yet achieve on our own.

In addition to technical development, everyone at Learners Guild makes a commitment to their own personal growth and to the personal growth of others. We do this as a necessary means of achieving the highest learning outcomes, and as an end in itself.

It can be an intensely fulfilling experience to progress and recognize one’s path towards mastery. We achieve Growth by co-creating an environment that challenges us out of our comfort zone, and supports us in overcoming these challenges. We cherish growth and development in all that we do, and when possible, raise the salience of this journey for our members, and ourselves.

## Look & Feel

**What’s possible:** An environment that is “high challenge, high support” enables me to accomplish things that I can’t do alone. I’m stretched and pushed into my Zone of Proximal Development, consistently working on challenges that are slightly out of my reach, but that I can effectively tackle with support and guidance.

**Feels like:** Working in my ZPD with adequate support is inherently joyful; I can tell I’m acquiring new skills, growing and developing my capacities. I’m challenged enough to tell I’ve accomplished something at the end of the day, but not so much that I feel consistently defeated or demoralized. There may be moments or even long stretches of frustration and struggle, but it’s in these moments that I feel safe enough to ask for help and the appropriate amount and type of support is available \(modeling, coaching, or encouragement\). I experience a sense of accomplishment and personal efficacy.

**Looks like:** High engagement, the room is “buzzing”, people are eager to help me \(and I’m eager to help them\) and tackle problems together. I know how to get help when I need it and where to get it from. When providing help, I know something about the right kind of help to offer \(does the person need me to show them? Talk them through it? Encourage them to stick with it through a challenging moment?\) High fives, exclamations of success, appreciations, funny dance moves, and encouragement abound.
