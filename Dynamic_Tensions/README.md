# Dynamic Tensions

Culture is made possible by holding pairs of seemingly paradoxical values that we call Dynamic Tensions.

We strive for an environment that doesnâ€™t trade one core value for the other, but instead holds tension between two sometimes seemingly paradoxical values, promoting both.

It's important that we hold these values as north stars to aspire to, not as impossible ideals to judge ourselves and each other by.
