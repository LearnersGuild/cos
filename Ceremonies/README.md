# Ceremonies

Weâ€™ve all participated in some kind of ceremony before. Graduations. Weddings. Birthday celebrations. Cultural or religious ceremonies. Ceremonies are time bound, typically facilitated by someone, or multiple people, and often happen either at regularly anticipated times (like ritual ceremonies), or at designated times with a clear beginning middle and end. A ceremony might take all day (like orientation or graduation), or might last a few minutes (like a morning standup). Sometimes practices are temporarily treated as ceremonies.

Ceremonies are often powerful, and need to be entered deliberately and freely. It's important that everyone knows and feels in choice about wether or not to participate.
