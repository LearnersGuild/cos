# Circle Feedback Ceremony

**Purpose:** To give and receive feedback about our work relationship

**Serves Values:** Truth. Being in Relationship


- Stand in a circle, or sit in a semi circle
- One at a time a feedback receiver takes the "hot seat" when they are ready
- Feedback giver raises their hand if they have feedback for them
- Receiver selects who to receive feedback from
- Giver completes **both** these two sentences:
  * "One of the reasons I want to work with you is...."
  * "I would want to work with you more if...."
- Receiver says "thank you" and when ready selects another giver

## Facilitation notes:

- It's important for the facilitator to participate
- Limit givers to 3 or 4, depending on group size. Announce the limit before start
- Invite people to breathe and take a minute before raising their hand for feedback to give everyone a chance to consider what they want to say
