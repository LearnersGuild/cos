# Home Group Ceremony

The purpose of a home group session is to deliberately deepen in our values together. We do a check in, followed by a climate check. After the climate check we build a list of proposals for how we’ll spend our time, and then collectively decide which of the proposals we follow.  

**Step 1:** [Check-in](check-in.md)

**Step 2:** [Climate check](climate-check.md)

**Step 3:** Build proposals

Existing components are suggested and new components are proposed, popcorn style.
If the proposal is regarding a new component, the proposers talk about which value(s), type of component, and give a quick (2 minute) overview of what it is. If the proposal is regarding an existing component, the proposer can choose to elaborate on why they are proposing it or just skip.


**Step 4:** Select proposal: Deciding where to dive

There is a reaction round of folks listing which components they would like to engage with and why. This could also include which components they prefer not to participate in. Participants can also suggest a new component during the reaction round if they wish. Facilitator chooses what’s next. Only picking one or two for the rest of the home group session.

If the proposal selected is a new component, the facilitator runs a [new experiment process](/Processes/new-experiment.md) and then facilitates the experiment itself. 

**(optional) Step 5:** If there is time left for another component, the facilitator initiates another select proposal round.
