# Clearing Ceremony

**Purpose:** Floss the crud that forms in relationships
**Serves Values:** Truth, Being in Relationship, Safety


- In a circle, review the clearing process and give an example of a clearing
- Remind people that appreciations are also a withhold
- Ask people to look around the circle, and hold up the number of relationships that they think could use a flossing, or there is a withhold there. Tally up the total.
- Turn on some music to create privacy for people's conversations
- Ask people to stand up and walk around. Find a partner. Look for something they have to clear, and then go ahead and clear it. If you have nothing, just share an appreciation.
- Thank your partner anyway you like and find another one.
- Remind people to make themselves available, take a risk, and take responsibility for their feelings. Watch out for triangulation and judgement. The idea is to risk "good enough" for "100% clear". The goal is not that we like each other, but that we are not holding something that keeps us from working well together. 
- If you know you have someone you need to clear with, walk up to them and wait.
- Come back to a circle, and do another "clearing count".
- Notice how the total has dropped and remind everyone that the goal is to keep the number at zero.
