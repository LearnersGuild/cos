# Challenge: A challengers main tool

A challenge is needed when you feel like there's a situation that needs to be addressed/confronted. Something is going on that needs to change/stop/improve.

## Challenge steps

There are four steps to a challenge:

1. Ask permission "Hey, I have a challenge for you, is now a good time?"
2. Briefly state what you're noticing "I noticed the last 3 projects, you got less than 40% complete on them"
3. Set a clear, time bound, actionable challenge  "I challenge you to get over 80% completeness on the next 3 projects"
4. Ask for acceptance, and be willing to hear yes, no, or to negotiate.
5. Pro step: Follow up with the person you challenged and hold them accountable.

When delivered well, a challenge feels like a gift. It feels like you are seeing my potential and inviting me to step into it. It feels like you're on my team.

## Persecutor traps

You know youâ€™re falling into Persecutor if you find yourself:

1. Judging / Criticizing
2. Feeling bigger / better / smarter than the other
3. Reaching for rules, standards to legislate cooperation
4. Insisting that the other person accept your challenge
5. Don't feel like you're on the other person's team
