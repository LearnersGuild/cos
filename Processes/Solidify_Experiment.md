# Solidify Experiment Process

**Purpose:** To decide wether or not to adopt a culture component that's on trial basis
**Serves Values:** Engagement, Truth (feedback)

## Reaction Round

One at a time, each person reflects out about wether or not they experienced as working to address/deepen its value(s) as they see fit. No response or interruption is allowed during someone’s reaction. Any type of reaction is welcome, from intellectual critiques to emotional outbursts. The only caveat is that reactions should not be engaging someone in particular. Everyone reacts except the proposer.

Reactions are the only step of the process when people can speak freely. It’s a perfect phase for providing different perspectives and suggesting improvements to the proposal, so that the proposer can integrate those changes if they like them.

## Amend & Clarify

After all reactions are complete, the original proposer can optionally amend the experiment based on the reactions. Only the proposer speaks; no discussion allowed.

Although the original proposer can modify the experiment however they want, the goal is for the proposer to amend their proposal if they found a better way to address their value(s). It’s not their job to address all the concerns and reactions they heard during the reaction round, or even to make improvements that were suggested by other participants.

## Objection Round

If they experiment was significantly amended, one at a time, the Facilitator asks each participant if they see “any reason why adopting this proposal would cause harm or is not safe enough to try”. The proposer also gets the opportunity to raise an objection. Objections are stated, tested, & captured without discussion. One person may have several objections, and everyone’s objections must be captured before we move to the next step.

## Integration

If one or several Objections were raised, the Facilitator moves to the Integration step. The goal is to amend the proposal so that it would not cause the Objection, and would still address the proposer’s original intentions. Objections are integrated one at a time. For each objection, the Facilitator facilitates a discussion to help integrate the objection. Mostly the objector and the proposer speak, but others can help as well. The discussion stops as soon as the objector and the proposer have both agreed that an amended proposal would not cause an objection while still addressing the proposer’s tension.

Once all objections are integrated, go back to an Objection round to ensure there is no new objections.

## Voting Round

Using a thumbs up / thumbs down / sideways the facilitator asks everyone to vote for adopting this proposal and/or extending the experiment.

- If two thirds or more gave a thumbs up, the experiment is adopted as a permanent culture component.
- If there are more thumbs up than thumbs down the experiment is extended for another trial period.
- If there are more thumbs down than thumbs up the experiment is dropped.
- Regardless of how many thumbs up it receives, an amended experiment cannot be permanently adopted and must be extended for another trial period.
