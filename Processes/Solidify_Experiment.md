# Solidify Experiment Process

- Reaction round (did it deepen the value?)
- Proposer decides whether or not to tweak it
- If they choose a tweak, then it goes through clarifying, reaction, and objection round. Then automatically into another trial period
- If it doesn’t get tweaked then it goes to a vote for final adoption
- Vote: If majority, then one more trial period. If two thirds, then it’s adopted. If less than majority, it’s dropped.
