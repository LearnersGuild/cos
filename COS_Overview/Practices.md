# Practices

Practices tend to be ongoing and are used as needed. For example, we practice clearing withholds when we realize weâ€™re holding onto feelings, perceptions or stories that are getting in the way of our connection with someone.

A practice is usually associated with a shared skill, or shared knowledge. For example, to practice **Non Judgement** as a collective their needs to be shared understanding of what judgement is and shared language around it. Introducing a practice should usually involve a teaching (or series of teachings) around it.

Our practices are aspirational. By definition, we will not do them perfectly, or consistently. Our commitment is to practice, fail, and then return again to the practice. Reminding each other when we forget, and reflecting to each other as we progress.
