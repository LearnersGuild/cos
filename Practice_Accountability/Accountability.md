# Accountability

**Serves Values:** Structure

Our agreements are meaningless if we don't hold ourselves and each other accountable to them. It is crucial that we step up to violated promises, broken commitments and bad behavior. In doing so, we maintain our integrity, and support each other lovingly and firmly in doing the same.

## Accountability Guidelines

- Only hold people accountable for things they've explicitly agreed to
