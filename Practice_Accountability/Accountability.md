# Accountability

**Serves Values:** Structure

Our agreements are meaningless if we don't hold ourselves and each other accountable to them. It is crucial that we step up to violated promises, broken commitments and bad behavior. In doing so, we maintain our integrity, and support each other lovingly and firmly in doing the same.

Accountability is a strategy that helps reshapes behaviours using peers and community as allies. Begin by picking an accountability aim. An accountability aim is a goal for a behavior change set over a period of time i.e. I want to be held accountable for showing up at 8:30 this week. The accountability process requires two parties. The person who is asking to be held accountable and the person or group of people who are committed to tracking the results of their agreement. The task of the second party is to provide increased awareness, not to act as a shamer or giver of negative consequence if the accountability goal is not met. We humans easily fall into focusing on the negative and as such failures are elevated in the mindâ€™s eye, taking up valuable attention resources.

Dynamic tension between being pulled forward and pushed from behind. An accountability relationship gives the participant the potential reward of succeeding and knowing that their peers acknowledge their achievement. On the flip side, there is the chance of failure and the fear of shame is another motivating force. Ideally, we would like to utilize every tool available, and thus the fear of failure and the reward of success can be balanced to provide maximum results. We must note, however, that negative emotions are processed faster and are more easily remembered. It is not hard to be motivated by fear, and so to create balance, we must give it much less attention. To have a balanced motivation tension, we must give praise and focus on positive results in at least a 2-1 ratio to negativity.

In the example of showing up late, let us imagine that the person showed up at 9:00 every day for the entire week. They failed to be accountable. The next week, they get to try again. In looking at the past week, they can gauge the difference between their real behaviour and their expectation of their ability to change. Next week, they should pick a accountability aim that is more achievable given their behavioural pattern. Perhaps they can pick 8:45 and see how that goes. Each cycle should bring them closer to being able to consistently succeed in their accountability aim. After enough successes, their self-beliefs and patterns will shift. They will have experienced that they can achieve their goals and that they are the kind of person who keeps their word and does what they say they are going to do. They will begin to notice that they can commit to more challenging goals and succeed in them. The key is making small enough steps in the beginning so that a pattern of success becomes strong and unwavering.

Accountability partners also known as accountability buddies enter into the accountability agreement voluntarily. They are committed to keeping track of their wards successes and failures and acting as a mirror.

If the person is not reaching their goal, they should get advice from the accountability partner(s). For example, if they consistently show up half an hour late, the partner(s) might advise them to get up half an hour earlier and leave their residence half an hour earlier. They should be praised and encouraged when they reach their goal.
