# Learners Guild Culture Operating System

Welcome!

Our learning environment is self-organizing, rigorously goal-driven, and personally and professionally rewarding. A powerful, positive culture is the strongest, most pervasive support structure a learning community can have.

This culture OS provides a framework by which we --as members of the learning collective-- can participate in co-creating a culture that draws out the best in us.

The Cultural OS defines the components of our shared culture and the processes by which members of the learning collective  can shape it.

Everyone is responsible for embodying and improving this culture.
