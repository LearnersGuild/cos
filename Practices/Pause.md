# Pause Practice

**Serves Values** Being Myself, Engagement

Anyone in our group is encouraged at a moment to ask everyone to pause in silence, offer a brief reflection, or not. Keep some amount of time, a minute or two (max), thank everyone, and resume.

- Not allowed at tactical meetings.
- Ok to do at governance meetings.
- Particularly used when we are in circle space.
