# Player Support Group

**Purpose:** The purpose of the player support group session is to provide a dedicated time where players can discuss how to play the game better, gain support from each other, and connect deeply with other players. We do a check-in, followed by an open conversation about game-related issues. The purpose of a house is to create a small community of practice that meets regularly in Player Support Meetings to intentionally support each other and deliberately co-create a thriving learning culture.

# Ceremonies

We’ve all participated in some kind of ceremony before. Graduations. Weddings. Birthday celebrations. Cultural or religious ceremonies. Ceremonies are time bound, typically facilitated by someone, or multiple people, and often happen either at regularly anticipated times \(like ritual ceremonies\), or at designated times with a clear beginning middle and end. A ceremony might take all day \(like orientation or graduation\), or might have a more discrete duration \(like a  Player Support Group meeting\).

Ceremonies are often powerful, and need to be entered deliberately and freely. It's important that everyone knows and feels in choice about whether or not to participate.

## Climate survey
health stat for culture is in retro as 7 questions in the retro so that there are direct stats related to COS so players will get more direct feedback on how they're upholding each tension

climate survey is the metric for how well pods/houses are doing on each tension

as a house you're taking on these numbers and moving them up


**Step 1: \*\***[Check-in](Check-in.md)\*\*

**Step 2: \*\***[Climate check](Climate-check.md)\*\*

**Step 3: Solidify Experiments**

* Run each proposal in a trial period through the [Solidify Experiment](/Processes/Solidify_Experiment.md) process.

**Step 4: Build proposals**

Popcorn style, participants suggest a process or ceremony for the group to do.

If the proposal is regarding a new component, the proposers name the type of component \(Ceremony, Agreement, Process, or Practice\), which value\(s\) it serves, and give a quick \(2 minute\) overview of what it is.

If the proposal is regarding an existing component, the proposer can choose to elaborate on why they are proposing it or not.

**Step 5: Select proposal**

There is a reaction round of folks listing which of the proposals they would like to engage with and why. This could also include which components they prefer not to participate in. Participants can also suggest a new component during the reaction round if they wish. Facilitator chooses what’s next. Only picking one or two for the rest of the home group session.

If the proposal selected is a new component, the facilitator runs a [new experiment process](/Processes/New-experiment.md) and then facilitates the experiment itself.

**\(optional\) Step 6: One more proposal** If there is time left for another component, the facilitator initiates another select proposal round.

**Step 7: \*\***[Checkout](Check-out.md)\*\*

## Facilitator notes

### Home Group Framing

* Purpose of Player Support Group is to deliberately co-create culture. Culture happens. It's not something we can control, but it's something we can intentionally impact. Culture is invisible and impacts us more than anything else. Our Cultural Operating System assumes two things: First: Culture is critical to succeeding. Second: We can be intentional about co-creating it, and deliberate in evolving it together.

* This can't be top down. At Enron there were great words on the wall: Integrity, Honesty, Service. Every company has words on the wall. This isn't trivial.

* We do it here using three steps.

  * Step 1: We agree on what the goal is. On what a great environment\/culture looks like.
  * Step 2: We try different things to deliberately move towards our goal.
  * Step 3: We measure how we're doing, and we try something else.


Home groups are a place for us to decide on what the next experiment is, and to discuss how the previous experiments are going.

### Misc Reminders

* Project the [Dynamic Tensions Board](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kTIV5f3U12BuIRzlgTiETbE0OTMRWiAtKgXdROvLcAY/edit#gid=773629604) to the group before starting.
* Introduce the "Process Timeout" and encourage anybody to use it to ask clarifying questions about the process. If this is an early group, set the expectation that there will be dozens of Process Timeouts since you won't be describing the process but jumping right in.
* Remind everyone about the agency & safety values. They have a choice about wether or not participate. They need to speak up if they don't feel safe. Ceremonies are by definition non-coercive. They must be entered willingly.
* Remind people they can pass in any go-around. If they pass, the facilitator will get to them at the end and give them one more opportunity to participate which they can take or leave.
* Note that start time and end time of the ceremony.
* Remind people to turn screens off and to protect the space from their "todos".
* People might need their screens during the **build proposals** step. Remind them to stay focussed and close their screens the moment they feel they have all their proposals in.
* Offer to let anyone facilitate the process at the beginning. Hopefully, one day, someone will take you up on it!

## Facilitator notes

Nonpurpose of houses = process feedback about the game. the game maker will hold weekly sessions for feedback.

more transparent about why vulnerability

learning support group / players group
get support learning how to play this game better

framing for last 50m: what supports people in this group? what's needed here?

what's my incentive to support other people if i'm here for myself?
- check ins help people care about each other
- creating a container where truth and love can unfold
- learners are 'attached' to each other via vulnerability, they care about each other because they know each other deeper

Facilitator Notes: asking people who are in the red to check in about it and make a plan / get support
