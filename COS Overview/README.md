# Overview

Culture happens. It's not something we can control, but it's something we can intentionally impact. Culture is invisible and impacts us more than anything else. Our Cultural Operating System assumes two things:

- First: Culture is critical to succeeding.
- Second: We can be intentional about co-creating it, and deliberate in evolving it together.

We define a great learning culture as one that upholds [five dynamic tensions](/Dynamic_Tensions/README.md), and we deliberately co-create it through [practices](/COS Overview/Practices.md) and a weekly [player support group](/COS Overview/Player_Support_Group.md).
