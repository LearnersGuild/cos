# Overview

Culture happens. It's not something we can control, but it's something we can intentionally impact. Culture is invisible and impacts us more than anything else. Our Cultural Operating System assumes two things: First: Culture is critical to succeeding. Second: We can be intentional about co-creating it, and deliberate in evolving it together.

## Cohort
A cohort is a set of learners with a shared start date and chapter. Cohorts are named after their start month: e.g. November Cohort, September Cohort. Cohorts go through orientation, and some foundational workshops together.

## House
Guild members are grouped into houses. A house spans members from multiple cohorts. The purpose of a house is to create a small community of practice that meets regularly in Player Support Meetings to intentionally support each other and deliberately co-create a thriving learning culture.
