# Collective Vision 

**Purpose:** Deepens understanding of the dynamic tension, and creates shared ownership \/ shared purpose

**Serves Values:** Engagement, Being in Relationship \(shared purpose\), Structure \(clarity\)

Group breaks out into triads who explore and flesh out a particular tension:

What it looks like when the values in that tension are honored.
What it feels like to be in a climate where the tension is held.
What the shadow of each value could look like if its corresponding value isn't held.

Each triad selects one person to present exploration to the group. A short discussion of the tension if facilitated.
