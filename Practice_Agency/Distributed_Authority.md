# Distributed Authority

## Overview

In a self organizing learning collective, there is no central learning authority. The power and agency usually held in the administration and the teacher is distributed across a community of peers.

The distributed authority means learners have more agency over the pace, content over their learning, and more control over their environment. It also means, they take on more responsibility than a learner in a traditional hierarchical learning environment.

## Shared Responsibility

In addition to practicing their craft, learners in a distributed authority take on traditional teacher and administration functions:

* Curating and authoring curriculum
* Assessing/Reviewing their peers' work
* Giving feedback to their peers on their team work and culture contribution
* Creating the learning culture
* Resolving interpersonal conflict
* Holding themselves and others accountable to shared agreements
* Caring for the physical space

The price of the extra freedom and agency, is the added burden of these shared accountabilities.  

## Freedom is stressful

Self directed learning is more stressful than "expert" directed learning:

- Learners in a self organizing environment have to contend with the subjectivity of the feedback they receive from their peers, which feels different than the seemingly expert, objective evaluations they are used to receiving from an "expert".
- Ongoing feedback is more valuable and nuanced for their learning, but it lacks the finality and relief of passing a test.
- There is no objective "right pace", so learners need to pace themselves and tolerate the ambiguity of not knowing the answers to the question "am I there yet? how close am I to the finish line?".
- Without a well worn path, and someone telling them what they should be working on, learners develop the skill and capacity to chart their own path, but have to deal with the anxiety of not knowing "am I working on the right thing?".
