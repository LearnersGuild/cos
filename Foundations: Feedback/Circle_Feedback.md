# Circle Feedback 

**Purpose:** To give and receive feedback about our work relationship

**Serves Values:** Truth. Being in Relationship

* Stand or preferably sit in a semi circle
* One at a time a feedback receiver takes the "hot seat" in front of the semi circle when they are ready
* Feedback giver raises their hand if they have feedback for them
* Receiver selects who to receive feedback from
* Giver completes **both** these two sentences:
  * "I trust you and want to work with you because...."
  * "I would trust you and want to work with you more if...."

* Receiver says "thank you" and when ready selects another giver

## Facilitation notes:

* It's important for the facilitator to participate
* Limit givers to 3 or 4, depending on group size. Announce the limit before start
* Invite people to breathe and take a minute before raising their hand for feedback to give everyone a chance to consider what they want to say
* Teach participants the jazz hands signal for agreeing and have them practice it once or twice and encourage them to use it to amplify the feedback that's being given
